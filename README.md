Repository for 'Artist's Book' for ENGL182 at UW

This is how the system is going to work:
*There will be a button which the user is going to press
*After pressing the button once, a random song is going to be played
*Pressing it for the second time, the same song will be translated to a language then translated back to English and replayed using [TODO] Google voice
*Pressing it for the third time, the same song will be translated to a different language then translated back to English and replayed 
*Pressing it once more repeats the cycle.
